# Project Directory Creator

## Overview

The **Project Directory Creator** is a Python-based application that allows users to create predefined directory structures for `web development projects`. The tool uses a GUI built with CustomTkinter to provide an intuitive interface for entering project names, selecting a directory, and generating the required folder and file structure with just a few clicks.

## Features

- **CustomTkinter GUI**: A clean and modern interface designed with CustomTkinter, making it easy to use and visually appealing.
- **Progress Feedback**: A progress bar starts in red, turns green upon successful creation of the directory structure, and reverts to red when a new directory is selected.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages if the project name is not entered or the directory is not selected.
- **Logs Area**: A dedicated section to display logs of all directories and files created during the process.
- **Predefined Structure**: Automatically generates a set of folders and files typical for web development projects.
